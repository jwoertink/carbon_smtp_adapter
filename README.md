# carbon\_smtp\_adapter

A simple SMTP-Adapter for [carbon](https://github.com/luckyframework/carbon).

## Versioning

The current plan is to track carbon's major and minor numbers, so that
carbon\_smtp\_adapter `0.1.x` is compatible with carbon `0.1.x` and so on.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  carbon_smtp_adapter:
    github: luckyframework/carbon_smtp_adapter
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "carbon_smtp_adapter"

# configure your base email class to use the smtp adapter:
BaseEmail.configure do |setting|
  settings.adapter = Carbon::SmtpAdapter.new
end
```

By default, carbon will try to deliver the email to an smtp server running on
`localhost` and listening on port `25`. If you need different settings, you can
configure the following (values shown are the defaults):

```crystal
Carbon::SmtpAdapter.configure do |settings|
  settings.host = "localhost"
  settings.port = 25
  settings.helo_domain = nil
  settings.use_tls = true
  settings.username = nil
  settings.password = nil
end
```
